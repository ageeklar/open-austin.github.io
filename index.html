    <h2>Our Events</h2>

    <p>Every month Open Austin hosts three events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Open Gov &amp; Civic Tech Meetup</b> - We invite a speaker from the civic tech community and try cover a broad range of topics. Normally at the Terrazas public library.</li>
            <li><b>Civic Hack Night</b> - We try to invite a non-profit or anybody with an idea for a civic tech project to come pitch their ideas. Then we break out into project-specific groups and work for about two hours. Normally at WeWork on 6th &amp; Congress.</li>
            <li><b>Civic Hack Saturday</b> - Like the Civic Hack Night but on Saturday's and without presentations. This is a comfortable space to come and work on a project for a few hours. Usually at Urban Co-Lab.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>In addition, every year we host three larger events. We could probably use another sentence or two here.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Code Across</b> - What is Code Across and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
        <li><b>Hack For Change</b> - What is Hack For Change and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
        <li><b>Ship It Weekend</b> - What is Ship It Weekend and why do we do it? Write a sentence or two about it.</li>
    </ul>
