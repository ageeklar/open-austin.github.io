<p>(Open Austin is a member of the CityUP consortium, which is producing this event.)</p>
<p>Are you interested in meeting people who want to improve transportation, safety, health, education, economic opportunity, sustainability, environmental quality, and more by using technology, data, and analytics?</p>
<p>Smart city projects strive to advance all aspects of city life by using technology, data, and analytics to improve our understanding of urban design &amp; planning, city infrastructure &amp; operations, and civic issues &amp; priorities. ‘Big Data’ is already transforming many industries and businesses, as well as education, research, and more. Smart city projects aim to collect data and use analytics to transform cities and the lives of the people in cities.</p>
<p>Austin CityUP™ is a new, comprehensive, city-wide consortium of companies, organizations, groups, and individuals that engage in smart city projects to advance Austin through digital technologies, data collection, analytics and modeling.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating or just learning more, please join us for a smart city reception at Austin City Hall. You will hear about the upcoming plans of Austin CityUP™, learn about new opportunities, and meet people who are dedicated to transforming cities, and lives through the development, implementation, and operation of smart city projects.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in advancing and improving Austin is welcome!</p>
<p>Enjoy free snacks and drinks and bring your ideas and business cards!</p>
