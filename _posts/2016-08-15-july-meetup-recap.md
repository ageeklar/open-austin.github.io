Last month Open Austin had a unique line-up of speakers. Our topic was Hacking the budget and we had Grace Miller with GlassHouse policy explain how the city budget could be influenced by the community. We also had Brandon Latham-Jones the outreach Director for District 4, Kerry O'connor from the Innovation Office, and Robert Friedman from the Mozilla Foundation.

##Budget Breakdown

For our meetup we had Grace Atkins from Glasshouse Policy give a presentation on why game nights and education around city budgeting is necessary. Glasshouse policy is a think-tank here in Austin that wants to engage the general public around public policy to help create a more responsive and representative government. They noticed the critical decisions that are being made at a local level and  wants others to understand local politics by actively engaging in policy and city decision making.

###Why the budget? 
Grace says that decisions being made around city spending aren't just big, vague, and to be ignored. City spending decisions impact our daily lives and go largely unnoticed due to inaccessibility to the general public. In order to breakdown barriers for understanding the budget, Grace pointed out that we have to be engaged and learning both in-person and online.


###Working to Gamify the budget
With that in mind Glasshouse Policy and Austin Monitor have teamed up for a budget game night that's happening tomorrow, August 16th at 6:00pm. 

[Austin Monitor](http://www.austinmonitor.com/) is a locally focused government reporting website. They wants to provide locals with a clear picture of what is going on in Austin. They do this by reporting in an intentionally neutral tone that helps readers make their own judgements on local politics.  

They believe that by collaborating to gamify the budget they can help folks understand where and how city money is being spent and where the money comes form. This is just one step to allowing more people to get involved and influence decisions that go into make the city budget.

Past involvement with volunteers, notably the [Budget-in-a-Box](http://www.budgetboxapp.com/welcome) app, has made the City of Austin rethink how they present the budget and continued engagement. 
Currently the city has a different budgeting platform for citizen engagement, [Dollars & Sense](https://austintx.budgetsimulator.com/). Though similar to Budget-in-a Box, Dollars & Sense prompts users to enter home value, an action that the rest of the experience then relies on to illustrate tax and utility bill changes. The game night and newest iteration on a budgeting app that Open Austin is helping to build, ensure that the conversation around participatory budgeting and citizen engagement continues. 

##Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund,
For our meeting Robert Friedman came to introduce [Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/gigabit/) to the community. Friedman said that Mozilla was in town to take advantage of the Google Fiber network in Austin. They hope to Build and fund educational resources that take advantage of gigbyte speed connections to advance learning opportunity for young people, explore big data, synchronized collaboration, and more. 

If you're interested in developing in the education sphere then Mozilla has a fund allocated for prototyping and growing projects out.

##Open Gov Partnership Update
Kerry O'Connor from the Innovation Office gave us an update on the Open Gov Partnership that the city accepted earlier this year. Kerry informed the group that we are the only U.S City apart of a subnational pilot program for Open Government and the program currently has a paired with Ireland with whom we support and share knowledge with. Open Austin, Leadership Austin, Vision Zero ATX, and the City of Austin are helping push this program forward. We support and share what we know with each other.

This is an implement Austin kind of thing&quot;- <a href="https://twitter.com/kerry_atx">@kerry_atx</a> on the Open Government Partnership</p>&mdash; Open Austin (@openaustin) <a href="https://twitter.com/openaustin/status/755202029467893760">July 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

We not only declare our commitments, we are held accountable. We have 1 year to implement any commitments that we come up with and they must be co-created with civil society. 


During [ATX Hack for Change a site was launched](http://cityofaustin.github.io/open-gov-partnership/) for the campaign and currently the team needs some help updating it among other task for their campaign to commitment.  

If you're interested in getting involved there is an [OpenGov channel in the Open Austin Slack] 
(https://open-austin.slack.com/messages/opengovpartnership/) where you can ask questions and engage.

##Direct Democracy
Braden Latham-Jones- D4 Outreach Director gave a quick presentation on budgeting in Austin and also plugged Gregario Casar's interest and past action in getting citizens to participate in government. 

City Management Vs. City Council.
City Management balances out the dynamics in power in larger city. This ensures that there isn't a strong mayer that appoints all the departments. City Manager manages the staff. 

The manager will purpose a budget to city council to amend and then improve.
