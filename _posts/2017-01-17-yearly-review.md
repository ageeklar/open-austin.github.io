When Open Austin was founded in 2009, [Obama's open data initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open) was just getting started. In the eight years since, the world is now a different place. Code for America [sent its Fellows](http://kut.org/post/what-can-code-america-do-austin) to inject tech talent into local government, including Austin as a pilot city in 2012. Five years ago, the White House recognized the first weekend in June as the [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/06/03/open-data-and-innovation-national-day-civic-hacking-2016), an event we co-present annually as the [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/).

It is interesting to juxtapose the history of Open Austin, and the larger national "Civic Tech" movement, with the presidential timeline. It reminds us just how young this work is. In 2017, our organization will experience its first presidential transition.

As our 45th President, Donald J Trump, is inaugurated in DC this week, we'd like to reflect on highlights from last year. Then we will lay out some challenges ahead.

## 2016 Recap

## 2017

Since the Election of Donald Trump, we've seen an increased hunger in our community for project and advocacy work that meets at the intersection of technology & government.

As an all-volunteer organization, we labored to accomplish the achievements listed above. This year, we want to deepen our impact and try harder to support existing organizations in our community.

In order to do this, our coreteam has chosen three internal projects and we'd like your help with it. **[Apply here to join our coreteam.](https://openaustin.typeform.com/to/zyE0a4)**

1. Membership Development Plan
  - We want to make it easier for volunteers to assume roles within the organization, on projects, and in planning. We want to accommodate varying levels of availability.
2. Formalizing Values
  - At our meetup in November, we facilitated a collaborative design exercise to find language that described the core values of Civic Tech. We want to distill these insights into a better reflection of why we do our work on our About Page.
3. Open Austin Labs
  - We want to prioritize projects that have formal partnerships with external stakeholders (like other non-profits or the City of Austin), clear goals and deadlines, and potential for funding.
