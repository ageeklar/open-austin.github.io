SXSW interactive takes place in Austin during March 10-15 this year. It will feature hundreds of of panels, workshops, and parties, and even a visit from President Obama.

As always, combing through all the official and unofficial events while keeping track of RSVPs can be super daunting, so we decided to help our our Open Data & Civic Tech friends with a curated list of relevant events to choose from.

Here are a few highlights, in chronological order:

*IBM Design Hive at SXSW
Friday, March 11, All Day
Hotel Van Zandt*
Official SXSW [Event](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_OE04783)

At 4PM, Russ Unger of 18F will present. Aside from being friends of Code for America and Open Austin, _“18F is a civic consultancy for the government, inside the government, enabling agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to operate, cost efficient, and reusable.”_

*Voter Technology: A Reimagined Future
Friday, March 11, 9:30 AM
Old School Bar, 401 E 6th St*
Official SXSW [Event](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP58068)

_“Aging voting technology means upcoming elections are more likely than ever to result in inaccurate ballots or in voters being unable to cast a ballot at all. This group of panelists is unafraid to both sound the alarm bells and inspire us all about what is at stake for the 2016 presidential election, what stands in the way of updated voter technology, and what the future of the voter experience could look like given the right tools.”_

*Dell Policy Hack
Saturday, March 12, 6:00 PM
 115 San Jacinto Austin, TX*
No Badge Required - RSVP [Here](https://dell-policy-hack.splashthat.com/)

_“Join Dell for an interactive hack-a-thon that tasks teams of policymakers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and students, along with a “coach”, to design solutions to policy challenges faced by entrepreneurs running growing businesses. The goal is to share the winning solution with the next president, recommending he or she implement them in their first 100 days in office.”_

*Civic Tech Hackers and Advocates Meet Up
