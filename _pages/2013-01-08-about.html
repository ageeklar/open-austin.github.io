<p><strong><em>Open</em><em> Austin</em></strong> is a citizen volunteer group that promotes open government, open data, and civic application development in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>We were formed in 2009 by citizens interested in the City of Austin web strategy and approach. Through a series of conversations, common ground was developed between the City and <strong><em>Open Austin</em></strong> to work together in a formal and recurring way. A strategic alliance was formalized between <em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Open Austin</strong></em> and the City, expressing our mutual interests to partner, innovate and improve on these civic issues.</p>
<p>The outcome of this process was when, at the end of 2011, the City of Austin unveiled its <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/">new website</a>. The new site developed by city staff, working in conjunction with local technology companies, based on a <a href="http://drupal.org/">free and open source content publishing platform</a>. Also, a dedicated open government <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/">data portal</a>, was released. Further, the City announced that Austin would sponsor a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/austin/">Code for America open government fellowship</a>.</p>
<p>Presently, <em><strong>Open Austin</strong></em> focuses on ensuring that all local public sector agencies embrace open data and open government principles, provide adequate oversight over public information, and support civic software developers.</p>
<p>In 2011, we advocated for the creation of an "Open Government" policy. In December 2011, the Austin City Council adopted an open government resolution.</p>
<p>In 2012, we advocated for the creation of a "Civic Innovation Office" in the city. In September 2012, the Austin City Council approved "seed funding" to create a civic innovation office.</p>
<p>We continue to actively engage the city on open government issues.</p>
<p>We coordinate our efforts online, through an open <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openaustin">email list</a> and periodic in-person meetups.</p>
