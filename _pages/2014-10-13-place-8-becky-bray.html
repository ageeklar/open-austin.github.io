<p><strong>Campaign Finance Data Challenge:</strong> <a class="badge-purple" href="/article/1181">declined</a></p>
<h3>Open Data</h3>
<p><em>Many of these issues, such as the Open Data Portal and Open Government Resolution, are discussed in our <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014_OpenAustin_OpenGovBriefing.pdf">Open Government Briefing Guide</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>⇒ 1. How will you encourage City departments to comply with the Open Government Resolution and place useful data on the <a href="http://data.austintexas.gov">open data portal</a> on a timely basis?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I would work with each department individually and develop particular benchmarks that are easily implementable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 2. How would you evaluate departments' compliance with the Open Government Resolution? Would you support a resolution to create a quarterly report card?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I would support the creation of a report card, but would want to develop the reporting criteria before specifying a time frame. In determining whether or not a department is in compliance I would like each to develop an information matrix that could then be the basis for compliance determination.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 3. Would you support a resolution to require that any software or software services purchased by the City must be accompanied by an open data plan that indicates how public data managed by that system will be made available to the public?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I think any software or software service should be evaluated on their individual merits. If the particular service or tool is what is best for our City and it does not have any open data plan, I would like to think we could figure out how to make it work with our Open Government needs and requirements.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Innovation Office</h3>
<p><em>⇒ 4. This past March, the City hired its first Chief Innovation Officer. What are the specific functions and initiatives you would like to see out of this office to advance the City's open government and open data efforts?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I think the newly created Innovation Officer position would allow for better interdepartmental communication and coordination. I would also like to see the officer expand the relationships between the technology community, university and college communities as well as the citizens of Austin.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Website and Online Services</h3>
<p><em>⇒ 5. What steps would you take to help ensure the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov">City of Austin website</a> </em><em>provides the tools and information that citizens and community groups want?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I would illicit input from the public, community representatives, business representatives, Open Austin and others to let the City know when things are missing or when items need to be posted. When a request is made there should be a notification placed on-line that includes the information being prepared as well as an anticipated posting date.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 6. Would you support action to create an online issue feedback/reporting system, where a citizen could report an issue with the City's website and other online properties, and track city response to that issue?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yes I would support this system. This would provide a layer of accountability and transparency and would let others know precisely which action is being taken and what the outcome will be.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 7. There are strong benefits to providing city information and services online. Many residents, however, experience barriers to access. (See discussion of "Digital Inclusion" in our Open Government Briefing Guide.) What do you see as the City's responsibility regarding digital inclusion, and what steps would you take to address these concerns?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The City needs to make the necessary provisions that allow all citizens the ability to access on- line information and service. This could include making sure libraries, community centers and educational centers have the necessary resources.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Open Data Exercise: Campaign Finance Filings</h3>
<p><em>The City of Austin currently posts candidate and office holder financial statements as scanned facsimiles (PDF format) of the filed, attested documents. In 2012, the City Council approved a resolution to post these filings in a searchable, digital form.</em></p>
<p><em>⇒ 8. What would you do to ensure this project is completed before the next municipal election?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I would like the innovation office as well as the City Clerk to develop an on-line submission form.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 9. Will you publicly post your campaign receipts and expenditures (as reported to the City on form C/OH) online, in CSV spreadsheet data format, within 30 days of filing a report with the Austin City Clerk? Where will you post it?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I will publish all data that is required by the City of Austin.</p>
</div>
</div>
