<p><strong>Campaign Finance Data Challenge:</strong> <a class="badge-blue" href="/article/1181">accepted</a></p>
<h3>Open Data</h3>
<p><em>Many of these issues, such as the Open Data Portal and Open Government Resolution, are discussed in our <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014_OpenAustin_OpenGovBriefing.pdf">Open Government Briefing Guide</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>⇒ 1. How will you encourage City departments to comply with the Open Government Resolution and place useful data on the <a href="http://data.austintexas.gov">open data portal</a> on a timely basis?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>While it’s the role of the Mayor and Council set general policy, it’s the role of the City Manager to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of municipal government. While in office, I plan to work closely with the city manager and council to make certain that all information is made available to the public online in a quickly and timely manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 2. How would you evaluate departments' compliance with the Open Government Resolution? Would you support a resolution to create a quarterly report card?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I do like the idea of a report to evaluate department’s compliance with the Open Government Resolution. However, I think either an annual or bi-annual report would be adequate.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 3. Would you support a resolution to require that any software or software services purchased by the City must be accompanied by an open data plan that indicates how public data managed by that system will be made available to the public?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yes, I would support a resolution to require that any software or software services purchased by the City must be accompanied by an open data plan that indicates how public data managed by that system will be made available to the public.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Innovation Office</h3>
<p><em>⇒ 4. This past March, the City hired its first Chief Innovation Officer. What are the specific functions and initiatives you would like to see out of this office to advance the City's open government and open data efforts?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I don’t know of any specific functions and initiatives I would like to see out of the Chief Innovation Officer, however, I do believe it is their role to advance the City's open government and open data effort at all cost.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Website and Online Services</h3>
<p><em>⇒ 5. What steps would you take to help ensure the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov">City of Austin website</a> </em><em>provides the tools and information that citizens and community groups want?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Since Austin attracts some of the best and brightest tech minds in the world, I’m sure we can find someone locally that can fix the numerous problems with the city website. I would also like to look into the creation of a citizen task force to improve it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 6. Would you support action to create an online issue feedback/reporting system, where a citizen could report an issue with the City's website and other online properties, and track city response to that issue?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yes, I would support action to create an online issue feedback/reporting system, where a citizen could report an issue with the City's website and other online properties, and track city response to that issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 7. There are strong benefits to providing city information and services online. Many residents, however, experience barriers to access. (See discussion of "Digital Inclusion" in our Open Government Briefing Guide.) What do you see as the City's responsibility regarding digital inclusion, and what steps would you take to address these concerns?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p> I do believe that it is the city’s responsibility to provide city information and services online. The obstacles that we must overcome are economic, educational, and are of the senses. To make information and services available to all of Austinites whether it’s through file types and/or website organization should be considered when it comes to Digital Inclusion.</p>

<h3>Open Data Exercise: Campaign Finance Filings</h3>
<p><em>The City of Austin currently posts candidate and office holder financial statements as scanned facsimiles (PDF format) of the filed, attested documents. In 2012, the City Council approved a resolution to post these filings in a searchable, digital form.</em></p>
<p><em>⇒ 8. What would you do to ensure this project is completed before the next municipal election?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I would work with the new Council, City Manager along with the Chief Innovation Officer to address the concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>⇒ 9. Will you publicly post your campaign receipts and expenditures (as reported to the City on form C/OH) online, in CSV spreadsheet data format, within 30 days of filing a report with the Austin City Clerk? Where will you post it?</em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yes, I will publicly post my campaign receipts and expenditures (as reported to the City on form C/OH) online, in CSV spreadsheet data format, within 30 days of filing a report with the Austin City Clerk. Until we have a system in place to post the filings in other ways, I will continue to use the system that’s provided.</p>
