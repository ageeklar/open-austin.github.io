<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p class="projects">The project status indicates the maturity and usability of a project. Only <span class="project-status">beta</span> and <span class="project-status">deployed</span> projects should be considered ready for general public use. The project status values are:</p>
<ul class="projects">
<li><span class="project-status">deployed</span> - provided for public use, may be undergoing further development, feedback and bug reports invited</li>
<li><span class="project-status">beta</span> - provided for use and feedback, not complete, still in development</li>
<li><span class="project-status">in development</span> - provided for development use, not fully functional, not intended for public use</li>
<li><span class="project-status">ideation</span> - proof-of-concept prototype, not robust or fully functional</li>
<li><span class="project-status">archival</span> - of historical interest, not being actively developed, feedback not invited, may need developer support</li>
</ul>
