## Interested in attending an upcoming event?
You can RSVP for upcoming events on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Austin/). We have two types of events, both are free and open to the public. For details visit [Events](/events).

Once a month we get together to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. They often feature a guest presentation and Q&A session.

Hack events occur throughout the month and allow attendees to collaborate on projects or pitch a new project idea.

## Want to help an existing project or suggest a new project?
We keep track of our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-austin ).

You can browse proposals for new Open Austin projects by [label](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/labels) or view the [entire list](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues). This is where you can suggest your own project ideas.

We also have a showcase of [projects that have reached a useable stage](/projects).
