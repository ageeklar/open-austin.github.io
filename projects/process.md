title: Open Austin Project Process
---

## We're working on a process for taking projects from an experiment to being official Open Austin projects.

[Code for America has the four project stages](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages):

- [Experiment](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#experiment) - Explore the problem/idea. Have lots of these.
- [Alpha](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#alpha) - Solve a person's/group's problem
- [Beta](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#beta) - More users
- [Official](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#official) - Impact

We would like to clarify what the expectations are and how projects move between these stages within Open Austin.

### To start an **Experiment** Project:

1. Do something and tell us about it, specifically open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues and tag it with experiment.
2. Tell us if you need any resources to get started (AWS hosting, Cartodb, mockup tools, etc.)
3. Come to an [Open Austin event](/events) and work on share your project

### Move from Experiment to **Alpha**

This is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project.

1. Identify a project owner(s)
2. Get approval from an Open Austin coreteam member
3. Explain
  - what problem the project tries to solve
  - who the users are
4. List the project on open-austin.org/projects [link to how-to](https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Project-Page)
5. Go through a code/architecture review
  - What is the architecture of your project? _We may ask you to make changes to the architecture._
  - How do you deploy the project?

### Move to **Beta**

The theme for beta status is "more users" and "more feedback," the project should be looking for more users and recording more metrics

1. You should look for government or community partners, if applicable
2. Start polishing the app
3. Have a sense of what metrics you'll be recording and using to measure impact
4. Plan some launch event



### Move to **Official**

A project becomes official when it's polished, well known and the project leaders have a good sense of the impact of the project

1. Have a launch event! Congratulations, you've done an awesome job, it's time to enjoy your work
2. Have your metrics for usage and impact readily available
