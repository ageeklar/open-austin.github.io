title: Open Austin Project Process
---

## We're working on a process for taking projects from an experiment to being official Open Austin projects.

Code for America has the four project stages
- experiment
- alpha
- beta
- official

But, it is not clear how to move between the stages in terms of Open Austin.

### To start an **Experiment** Project:

1. Do something and tell us about it, specifically open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues and tag it with experiment.
2. Tell us if you need any resources to get started (AWS hosting, Cartodb, mockup tools, etc.)
3. Come to an [Open Austin event](/events) and work on share your project

### Move from Experiment to **Alpha**

This is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project.

1. Identify a project owner(s)
2. Get approval from an Open Austin coreteam member
3. Explain
  - what problem the project tries to solve
  - who the users are
4. List the project on open-austin.org/projects [link to how-to](#)
5. Go through a code/architecture review
  - What is the architecture of your project? _We may ask you to make changes to the architecture._
  - How do you deploy the project?

### Move to **Beta**

_TODO_

### Move to **Official**
