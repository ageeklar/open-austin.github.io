Support: 

HB 2596, among other things, would require home-rule municipalities to provide GIS files of its boundaries and extra-territorial jurisdiction. It would also require the production of a digital map to accompany annexation plans. http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02596I.htm

HB 2044 has openness provisions about traffic stops and police discipline records, plus provisions dealing with police use of force in other ways. http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02044I.htm

HB 839 would change the Open Records Act's exception for contract bids, which contain competitive information. The bill would change the statute so that the exception didn't apply once a contract was awarded. http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00839I.htm

SB 407 and HB 792 also close the Open Records Act's exception for contract bids. The Statesman published an editorial strongly supporting these bills, which were introduced in response to a Texas Supreme Court case called Boeing. (http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/commentary-texas-must-repair-damage-public-information-act/5ZvyZur7pm5HEJqyzb8zDL/) The Tribune wrote about the Boeing decision, saying it prevented disclosures about Uber's operations in Houston, among other things. https://www.texastribune.org/2016/08/05/lawmakers-eye-monstrous-loophole-keeps-contract-de/

"The Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas and other open government advocates are pressing for additional transparency measures in the Legislature. [House Bill 2670] attempts to improve access to public records stored in private email accounts and on private electronic devices. [House Bill 2710] seeks to resume access to dates of birth in certain public records, including crime documents and election filings, which fosters accuracy and informs the public." "Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, authored the bills."(http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/commentary-texas-must-repair-damage-public-information-act/5ZvyZur7pm5HEJqyzb8zDL/)

HB 793 would expand the definition of "governmental body" to particular contractors. Chris said: "my guess here is that the target contractors are private entities that operate toll roads. In North Texas, where Rep. Capriglione resides, privately run toll roads are particularly common." According to the Statesman editorial, HB 793 would supersede the *Greater Houston Partnership* Texas Supreme Court decision http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1706354.html,  http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00793I.htm  


Oppose:

HB 1258, introduced by state Rep. Travis Clardy, R-Nacogdoches, would prevent anyone, including the state government, from allowing online public access to court records currently held by counties. The state Office of Court Administration was planning on charging for access to the records through the state's new PACER-like database called "re:SearchTX". Even though the fees for the state database will be exorbitant at up to $6 per document, the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court thinks it will be an improvement for people who can't afford a lawyer. The Texas Tribune quotes him as saying: 

“We’re talking about tens of thousands of people for whom getting a court record is probably impossible, at least practically,” [...] “It’s just crucial,” Hecht said. “It’s important for transparency. The media and the public at large have a very fundamental interest in the public justice system.”

The Statesman also reported on HB 1258:

HB 526 would amend the open-records statute to entitle only residents to public information. (Currently, anyone can submit an public-information request and governmental entities have a duty to fulfill them under the terms of the Government Code.) In addition to restricting the free flow of public information, this could be burdensome to both persons making requests and entities fulfilling them if the residence of the person requesting needs to be verified. http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00526I.htm


Undecided:

HB 2670 would require government employees who keep public information on personal devices to provide that information to the governmental entity for retention. Failure to do so could result in a $1000 fine or six months in jail if it's related to a request for public information. It would also count as official misconduct. http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02670I.htm

SB 92 would amend the Local Government Code to say "A county, municipality, or other political subdivision may not adopt or enforce a local law that creates a protected classification or prohibits discrimination on a basis not contained in the laws of this state."
