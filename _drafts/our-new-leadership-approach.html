## Organizing a brigade requires a lot of a few people or a decent amount of work from a lot of people.

### The Problem

We accomplished a lot [in 2016.](https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2017/01/17/yearly-review) We hosted our own events at increased frequency, partnered with new organizations on events and projects, continued policy and advocacy efforts forward, and saw [42 new project ideas](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20created%3A2016-01-01..2016-12-31%20) come through. 

We also witnessed an increased community interest in our type of work since the November 2016 election, and found ourselves scrambling for ways to channel all of this energy. It's a worthwhile effort, but it's super time consuming. Open Austin is a volunteer run organization and relies on our members' surplus energy and passion. We expect this community to continue to last and to grow, but we realized in order to do that, we need to start thinking about what sustainability looks like. And one of the areas ways we decided to do that was to rethink our leadership model.

### The Process

We started by having a retreat in December 2016 where we came together and talked about everything we're doing, and what a better leadership structure might look like based on that. One team got together and created a roadmap for defining and filling new leadership roles.

#### 1. Invite the Community to Co-Create the Model

We wanted to [share what we're up to](https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2017/01/17/yearly-review) as early on as possible so we could get feedback on our approach. After just doing this post we had several people express interest, confirming our instinct that people were interested in the opoprtunities, we just haven't been marketing them well. 

#### 2. Team Leads: Prioritize Critical Roles & Fill Them

This took a few coreteam huddles before we finalized our "snowflake" ... AKA our leadership organizational structure 
![link here](). The main missing piece was a resources lead and a delivery lead, but some existing members shifted around and new members filled in those roles.

#### Team Leads: Write Their Team's Requirements

Then we asked each "snowflake branch" to list all the responsibilities on their team, and write [corresponding roles.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbS0wJj9o_Xr5yKBJ2oF9_wAPscZ2gksnOyMMuqVHk4/edit#heading=h.luseebsphfta) This document is our build on Code for America brigade leadership documentation

#### Document Onboarding Process to Make It Easy To Join

Lastly, we wanted to publish this process in a super obvious place to make sure it was easy for anyone to come across. So here it is! 

##### 1. Start showing up to [hack nights and meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Austin/)
##### 2. Apply to the leadership team using [typeform](https://openaustin.typeform.com/to/zyE0a4)
##### 3. [Ping us](https://github.com/open-austin/iced-coffee/issues/info@open-austin.org) to let us know you filled out the application, and ask when the next leadership team meeting is scheduled.
##### 4. Look at our [leadership "snowflake" model](need to link to this) and decide where you would like to contribute.
##### 5. Show up to a leadership meeting
##### 6. Create your own [onboarding card](https://github.com/open-austin/iced-coffee/issues/211) and assign to [@mateoclarke](www.github.com/mateoclarke)

### Our Hopes

We hope that creating a larger leadership team and decentralizing some of the responsibility will make the longevity of Open Austin possible, by reducing the amount of pressure on individual leaders and distributing the leadership opportunities more widely. Many of us are feeling the weight lifted already. But even if nothing else, this process was a great way to recognize how much work we do, how far we've come as leadership and as a brigade, and create mental bandwidth to think about our future direction.
