<p>1. Do you support the adoption of a comprehensive Open Government Directive by the City of Austin? The Open Government Directive would outline a consistent approach to open data, technology-enabled citizen engagement, open decision-making algorithms, and civic application development and be based on existing documents such as model <a href="http://publicequalsonline.com/localopengovdirective">legislation</a> developed by the Sunlight Foundation, Code for America, and Civic Commons.</p>
<p>I am undecided, but intrigued...I definitely want to learn more about an "Open Government Directive". I support open government and appreciate your suggesting methods to ensure it. If elected, I will meet with you ASAP to learn more.</p>
<p>2. Do you support the inclusion of the municipal Open Government Directive’s goals as performance benchmarks for each City of Austin department?</p>
<p>Same as #1</p>
<p>3. Do you support releasing software developed by the City to the public, under an OSI approved <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source license</a>, through initiatives such as <a href="http://civiccommons.org/">Civic Commons</a>?</p>
<p>Same as #1</p>
<p>4. Do you support the existence of an Information Authority modeled after the U.K.’s <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/about_us.aspx">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> to provide oversight of government data as a public good?</p>
<p>I like this idea! I am curious as to how much it might cost to start up and operate an Information Authority. Do you have any cost estimates?</p>
<p>5. Do you support studying whether Austin should join cities such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., in pledging support for a publicly-accessible open-standard protocol for 311 services, such as the currently proposed <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/API">Open311 API </a>specification?</p>
<p>I support studying this.</p>
<p>6. Do you support the creation of an application development contest that leverages public data and APIs?</p>
<p>I am undecided on whether to support such a contest, but want to find out further details.</p>
<p>7. How will you and/or your staff use social media to promote citizen engagement and improved service delivery?</p>
<p>My staff will include a social media expert to promote citizen contact in all feasible ways. Democracy requires the interest and participation of the citizens, and technology is creating new means of engagement.</p>
