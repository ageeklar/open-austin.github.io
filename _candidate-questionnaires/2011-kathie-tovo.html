<p>1. Do you support the adoption of a comprehensive Open Government Directive by the City of Austin? The Open Government Directive would outline a consistent approach to open data, technology-enabled citizen engagement, open decision-making algorithms, and civic application development and be based on existing documents such as model <a href="http://publicequalsonline.com/localopengovdirective">legislation</a> developed by the Sunlight Foundation, Code for America, and Civic Commons.</p>
<p>Supportive. I believe such an approach could improve the city government and help address the current problems of transparency, records retention, and the public's right to open public deliberation on issues.</p>
<p>2. Do you support the inclusion of the municipal Open Government Directive’s goals as performance benchmarks for each City of Austin department?</p>
<p>Supportive. I support performance benchmarks, of course - the particulars would need to be developed for each department.</p>
<p>3. Do you support releasing software developed by the City to the public, under an OSI approved <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source license</a>, through initiatives such as <a href="http://civiccommons.org/">Civic Commons</a>?</p>
<p>Supportive. I find open source and civic commons interesting in their potential to democratize government. I would like our community to explore the potential.</p>
<p>4. Do you support the existence of an Information Authority modeled after the U.K.’s <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/about_us.aspx">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> to provide oversight of government data as a public good?</p>
<p>Undecided. I need more information about how and where an information authority would operate.</p>
<p>5. Do you support studying whether Austin should join cities such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., in pledging support for a publicly-accessible open-standard protocol for 311 services, such as the currently proposed <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/API">Open311 API </a>specification?</p>
<p>Supportive. I would appreciate additional information concerning the steps necessary to develop an open-standard protocol for 311 services for Austin.</p>
<p>6. Do you support the creation of an application development contest that leverages public data and APIs?</p>
<p>Supportive. I believe an application development contest would yield some great ideas and show the depth of creativity and talent across our community. Such a contest would also likely strengthen the government's connection to the community.</p>
<p>7. How will you and/or your staff use social media to promote citizen engagement and improved service delivery?</p>
<p>I will use my city website page and social media to provide information about key events and issues. I am supportive of methods and means that increase the public's active involvement in their local government.</p>
