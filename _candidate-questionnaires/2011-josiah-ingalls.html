<p>1. Do you support the adoption of a comprehensive Open Government Directive by the City of Austin? The Open Government Directive would outline a consistent approach to open data, technology-enabled citizen engagement, open decision-making algorithms, and civic application development and be based on existing documents such as model <a href="http://publicequalsonline.com/localopengovdirective">legislation</a> developed by the Sunlight Foundation, Code for America, and Civic Commons.</p>
<p>Yes, I would support the adoption of a comprehensive Open Government Directive by the City of Austin.</p>
<p>2. Do you support the inclusion of the municipal Open Government Directive’s goals as performance benchmarks for each City of Austin department?</p>
<p>Yes, I do support the inclusion of the municipal Open Government Directive’s goals as performance benchmarks for each City of Austin department.</p>
<p>3. Do you support releasing software developed by the City to the public, under an OSI approved <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source license</a>, through initiatives such as <a href="http://civiccommons.org/">Civic Commons</a>?</p>
<p>Yes, I would support the release of software developed by the City to the public.</p>
<p>4. Do you support the existence of an Information Authority modeled after the U.K.’s <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/about_us.aspx">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> to provide oversight of government data as a public good?</p>
<p>Yes, I would support the existence of an Information Authority.</p>
<p>5. Do you support studying whether Austin should join cities such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., in pledging support for a publicly-accessible open-standard protocol for 311 services, such as the currently proposed <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/API">Open311 API </a>specification?</p>
<p>I would support Open311 in Austin.</p>
<p>6. Do you support the creation of an application development contest that leverages public data and APIs?</p>
<p>Yes, I would support the creation of this contest.</p>
<p>7. How will you and/or your staff use social media to promote citizen engagement and improved service delivery?</p>
<p>I would use social media to make it easier for citizens to reach me with their concerns or make appointments with me and my staff. Social media also offers another opportunity to let citizens know what is going on with the City on a day to day basis.</p>
